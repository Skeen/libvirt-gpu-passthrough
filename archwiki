=== Skeen's Virtual Gaming Rack Machine ===
Still work in progress.

Hardware:
* '''CPU''': AMD FX(tm)-8350
* '''Motherboard''': MSI 970A SLI Krait Edition (MS-7693) (Revision 5.0, BIOS/UEFI Version: 25.4)
* '''Host GPU''': ASUS GeForce GTX 480 1536MB
* '''Guest GPU''': ASUS GeForce GTX 480 1536MB
* '''RAM''': 2x8GB Kingston HyperX Fury White DDR3 1866MHz
* '''Storage''': 2x250GB Samsung EVO (MZ-75E250) set up in LVM striped mode (with mdadm), 2x1TB WD Blue (WDC_WD10SPCX) for storage. 250GB LVM volume as writeback cache for HDD.

Configuration:
* '''Host Kernel''': Linux 4.9.0-3 (No ACS)
* '''Host OS''': Debian Stretch
* '''Guest OS''': Windows 10 Home (10_1703_N, International Edition)
* Using '''libvirt QEMU/KVM with OVMF''': See [https://github.com/Skeen/libvirt-gpu-passthrough Github]

Issues you've encountered:
* Identifical GPUs; solved [[PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Using_identical_guest_and_host_GPUs|using this section on the wiki]], but with the script from the [[Talk:PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Using_identical_guest_and_host_GPUs_-_did_not_work_for_me.|corresponding discussion page]]. Several adaptations for Debian were required too, but aren't applicable for this forum.
* "Error 43: Driver failed to load";
** Spoofing vendor_id caused Windows to crash during boot-up.
** Linux VMs complain unable to find GPU from Grub2, and booted into blind-mode, but would still pick up the graphics card during the boot process, and would remain functional until VM reboot.
** Vendor_id spoofing turned out to work after solving the real problem (Missing UEFI compatability in VBIOS).
* Missing UEFI (OVMF) compatability in VBIOS;
** Requested a GOP/UEFI compatible VBIOS upgrade from ASUS, but ASUS could neither understand the request, or provide the upgrade (The only thing supplied was standard support answers).
** No compatible VBIOS was found at [https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/ TechPowerUp].
** Finally solved by manually hacking GOP/UEFI support into the ROM, using [http://www.win-raid.com/t892f16-AMD-and-Nvidia-GOP-update-No-requests-DIY.html GOPupd]. Current rom was dumped within a Windows 10 VM using GPU-Z, then modified using GOPupd, pulled to Linux, and provided using the rom file parameter in the VM XML file.
* VM only uses one core (even with mode=host-passthrough): solved [[PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#VM_only_uses_one_core|using this section on the wiki]].

Quirks:
* The GPU that is being passed through, [[PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Passing_through_a_device_that_does_not_support_resetting|does not support resetting]], and thus doing a hard-reboot / shutdown of the VM locks the GPU.
** The VM cannot be started again unless the Host machine is rebooted.
*** When doing a clean reboot / shutdown, allows the VM to start up as expected without reboot..
** Removing and rescanning the PCI device, does not change anything.
** No further attempts at powercycling the GPU from the host has been done (Yet).
* [[PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Passing_VM_audio_to_host_via_PulseAudio|Passing VM audio to host via PulseAudio]] results in heavy crackling.
** Using [[PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Slowed_down_audio_pumped_through_HDMI_on_the_video_card|Message-Signaled Interrupts]] have not been attempted (Yet).
